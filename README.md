# Analyzing-the-Impact-of-Car-Features-on-Price-and-Profitability

## 1. Project Description:
The automotive industry is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by factors like fuel efficiency, sustainability, and technological advancements. This evolution has led to a diverse landscape of vehicle options, including electric, hybrid, and alternative fuel cars alongside traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. As consumer preferences shift, understanding the factors influencing their choices becomes critical for car manufacturers. In this context, data analysis emerges as a powerful tool to optimize price.
The dataset contains information on over 11,000 car models and their specifications, including details on the car's make, model, year, fuel type, engine power, transmission, wheels, number of doors, market category, size, style, estimated miles per gallon, popularity, and manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP).
## 2. Approach:
### Data Cleaning and Pre-processing: 
> Before starting the analysis, we cleaned and processed the data to ensure its accuracy and reliability. This involved tasks like handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and addressing any inconsistencies or errors in the dataset.

### Analytical Methods: 
> We used various analytical methods, including descriptive statistics, data visualization, regression analysis, and correlation analysis. These methods helped us uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the dataset.

### Modelling Techniques: 
> Regression analysis was utilized to identify the key factors influencing car prices. This technique helps quantify the relationship between independent variables (car features) and the dependent variable (car price). By examining coefficient values, we assessed the relative importance of different features.

### Insights: 
> Used Excel a visualisation tool to draw graphs and finding insights. And finally drawn conclusions from insights and made recommendations

## 3. Tech-Stack Used:
   
> In this project, Microsoft Excel 2010 was used primarily for data analysis and visualization. The purpose of using Excel 2010 was to leverage its familiar interface. 
Overall, Microsoft Excel 2010 served as a versatile and accessible tool for conducting data analysis and visualization

## 4. Insights:

### A) How does the popularity of a car model vary across different market categories?

###  B) What is the relationship between a car's engine power and its price? 
 * It is clearly shows that the as the engine power increases the price of car also increases.
